## Steps to run the application

1. **Client Development Server** - Move to path "client/" and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

2. **Express Server** - Move to path "server/" and run `npm start` to fire up the express server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Express Server serves all the REST API calls from client.
